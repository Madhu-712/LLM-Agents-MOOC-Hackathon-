# LLM-Agents-MOOC-Hacksthon-
 Flight status  agents powered by Gemini (LLM) within a LangChain React agent framework. Users can input details about a flight (e.g., flight number, route, date) using natural language, and the application leverages the Gemini LLM and Tavily API to understand the request and retrieve the relevant flight status information.

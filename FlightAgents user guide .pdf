Flight Agent User Guide
This guide explains how to interact with the Flight Agent, an AI-powered tool designed to
provide you with real-time flight information.
Getting Started:
Currently, the Flight Agent is a prototype developed for a hackathon and is not yet publicly
available. This guide outlines the intended functionality for future public release. Imagine
interacting with the agent through a chat interface, similar to messaging apps.
Interacting with the Flight Agent:
You can ask the Flight Agent questions about flights using natural language. Here are some
examples:
● Flight Status: "What is the status of flight UA123?"
● Specific Information: "What time is flight AA456 scheduled to arrive?"
● Weather integration queries: “How is the weather at Sanfrancisco on Dec
5,2024?Is it ideal for the flight EK226 to take off at 8.30 pm?
● Real-time Tracking (Future Feature): "Where is flight DL789 currently?"
● Travel Disruptions (Future Feature): "Is my flight BA246 delayed?"
● Airport Information (Future Feature): "What gate does flight AF312 depart from?"
Tips for Effective Queries:
● Be as specific as possible with your flight information (e.g., airline code and flight
number).
● Use clear and concise language.
● For future features, you can ask more complex questions involving layovers,
connections, and other travel-related information.
Example Interaction:
User: "What is the status of flight UA123?"
Flight Agent: "Flight UA123 is scheduled to depart from San Francisco International Airport
(SFO) at 10:00 AM PST and arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) at 5:00 PM
EST. The flight is currently on time."
Future Enhancements:
We are actively working on enhancing the Flight Agent with features such as:
● Real-time flight tracking
● Integration with other travel services (e.g., hotels, car rentals)
● More sophisticated responses to complex queries
● Direct integration with airline APIs
Feedback:
As we continue to develop the Dl8ght Agent,your feedback is invaluable. Please share any
suggestions or issues you encounter to help us improve the experience. (Contact
information will be provided upon public release.)
